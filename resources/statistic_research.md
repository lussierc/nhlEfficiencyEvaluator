# NHL Statistic Research

Provides basic notes on the major variables currently used to track NHL statistics and predict future outcomes.

## Ways to Scrape NHL Statistics
There are a variety of libraries that make it easy to scrape NHL statistical data. One library I found previously is in *Python* and is called `nhlscrapi`. [This library](https://pythonhosted.org/nhlscrapi/) accesses "NHL game data including play-by-play, game summaries, player stats, etc". The library hides the backend of the NHL website scraping process and gathers data with ease.

In *R*, there is a widely used package called `nhlscrapr` that could be used in correlation with a Stepwise Regression implementation in R if that is the route I chose to take.
