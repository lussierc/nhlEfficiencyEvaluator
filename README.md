# nhlStatisticProjections
Spring 2021 Independent Study. Determine what the key stat variables are in the NHL and work to project player statistics/daily fantasy value in future games.

## Preliminary Project Plan

1. Identify whether it would be easier to complete this project in either R or Python, while considering that a Stepwise Regression could be completed in R and the projection tool could be implemented in Python.
2. Scrape data from NHL API.
3. Perform stepwise regression and perform research on key statistics. Detail my findings from this stepwise regression in a quick report.
4. Identify the best method to implement a projection model (what ML method?).
5. Implement a projection model for player stats in upcoming NHL games.
6. Ensure the program is well-tested.
7. Detail findings in a finalized report.
